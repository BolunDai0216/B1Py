    "This example aims to read the pose of objects published by the Vicon tracking system. Here we rely on the [vicon_bridge](http://wiki.ros.org/vicon_bridge) ROS node to communicate with the Tracker software and publish the poses of the tracked objects as TF broadcasts. Before following through this tutorial, maker sure that the following network structure is established and the `vicon_bridge` is properly configured and started. To learn more about this, you can refer to [this]() internal documentation.\n",
